                <![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m at OOP this week and had the pleasure yesterday to meet <a href="http://wingman-sw.com/about">James Grenning</a> for the first time. We had an inspiring conversation last night exchanging tips and strategies on how we inspire developers to try XP practices like TDD and pair programming.</p><p>I really like his approach for TDD. James asks devs at the beginning of a course: List what you like about developing software, and what you don&#8217;t like. After practicing TDD in the course, students have learned that TDD helps them spend more time on the things in the first list and less on the things in the second&#8230;</p><h2>Pair Programming Saves Time</h2><p>How do we spend our time when we develop software? My rough heuristics is this: We spend</p><ul><li>70% of our time reading code and trying to understand it,</li><li>20% of our time solving problems, creating solutions, and</li><li>10% of our time actually writing code (aka typing).</li></ul><div id="attachment_2730" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/trustartist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PPEconomics.png"><img class="wp-image-2730 size-medium" src="http://i2.wp.com/trustartist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PPEconomics.png?resize=580%2C435" alt="Pair Programming Economics" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Pair Programming Economics</p></div><p>This model has been convincing to managers and devs alike:</p><p>Managers understand that their concern that two expensive minds will be wasted using only one keyboard is based on a misinformation. The one keyboard for two pairs of hands can only be a limiting factor if we spend most of our time typing.</p><p>90% of our work is more effective using two minds:</p><ul><li>We will understand the code faster which we want to change, and be more courageous in changing it so we may move forward faster.</li><li>We will solve the problem faster and potentially find a better solution more quickly as we have more available options in two brains.</li><li>While one of us is typing, the other&#8217;s awareness increases quality: catching mistakes faster than the compiler/the tests could.</li></ul><h2>Feedback</h2><p>What do you think? How do you explain the benefits of pair programming and other XP practices? Thanks for joining the conversation!</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://trustartist.com/2015/01/27/pair-programming-economics/">Pair Programming Economics</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://trustartist.com">Trust Artist</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                <![CDATA[<p>I ran a product owner training this week and experimented with Clean Language for the first time in a group setting. I started the two days with a simple version of the <a href="http://www.cleanlanguage.co.uk/articles/articles/276/1/3-Simple-Steps-for-Better-Meetings/Page1.html">Clean Setup</a> by Caitlin Walker:</p><div id="attachment_2723" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/trustartist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/WorkshopAsYouLike.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2723 size-medium" src="http://i2.wp.com/trustartist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/WorkshopAsYouLike.jpg?resize=580%2C435" alt="Workshop As You Like" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">When this Workshop goes just As You Would Like&#8230;</p></div><h2>Clean Setup</h2><p>&#8220;When this workshop goes just as you would like, it will be like what?&#8221;</p><p>I started asking one of the participants this question. Then I helped him discover more with the two &#8220;<a href="http://learncleanlanguage.com/learn/2-conversational-clean/2-2-the-clean-language-questions/">Lazy Jedi questions</a>&#8220;:</p><ul><li>What kind of X (is that X)?</li><li>Is there anything else about X?</li></ul><p>where &#8220;X&#8221;<span style="color: #222222;"> represents one or more of the words used by the other person. The magic of Clean Language is that by only using the words you heard, you help them <a title="Paul Klipp: Components of Listening Part I" href="http://trustartist.com/2014/09/01/paul-klipp-listening/">develop their thoughts</a> without adding much of your own thinking.</span></p><p>Next, I asked him to guide me with the questions, and he did. I developed a metaphor of a band rehearsing for a concert, which gave me beautiful insights into what I wanted from the training. Metaphors have this beautiful effect of gently tapping into your unconscious.</p><p>After a quick explanation of the three questions and how they work, I instructed the participants to pair up and do the same for five minutes each. Results were astonishing for everyone. They loved it!</p><h2>Clean Learning about Yourself</h2><p>The next morning, I started with this question: &#8220;When you are learning at your best you are like what?&#8221; and again the two Jedi questions to help discovery.</p><div id="attachment_2722" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/trustartist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/LearningAtYourBest.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2722 size-medium" src="http://i0.wp.com/trustartist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/LearningAtYourBest.jpg?resize=580%2C435" alt="Learning At Your Best" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">When You&#8217;re Learning At Your Best</p></div><p>Again, participants reported they learned a lot about themselves and each other. At the end of the training, Clean Language was reported as one of the main takeaways in the feedback. I&#8217;ll definitely do more of that next time!</p><h2>Acknowledgements</h2><p>I was introduced to Clean Language by <a href="http://adaptivecollaboration.com/2014/11/13/self-retrospection-or-my-own-clean-feedback-on-the-3-techniques-workshop-at-agiledc-2014/">Andrea Chiou</a>. She&#8217;s been interviewed on <a href="http://www.infoq.com/interviews/andrea-chiou-clean-language-clean-questions-agile2014">Clean at Agile 2014</a>.</p><p>I&#8217;m currently participating in Judy Rees&#8217; <a href="http://www.xraylistening.com/store/metaphor-mastery/">Metaphor Mastery Class</a>. Highly recommended!</p><p>I&#8217;ll keep you posted on my learning journey with Clean Language.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://trustartist.com/2015/01/22/clean-learning-at-your-best/">Clean Learning at your Best</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://trustartist.com">Trust Artist</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                <![CDATA[<p>It’s all about how we show up. If we show up in a way that invites people to connect, to trust, to feel safer than usual, they probably will. And astonishing results will follow. Michael and I have a vast experience of limiting our results because we didn’t dare to show up, speak up, stand up. We’ve been not daring, not trying, not challenging, most of our lives—like most people! We’ve learned the hard way how to show up in a way that enables connection, and impact.</p><p>We use the VAST cycle to increase connection to grow engagement in the workplace. We know safety and trust are important, but that is not the whole story. We need whole humans, intensely connected, to unleash the co-creation of astonishing results.</p><p>Joint post with <a href="http://agilitrix.com/2015/01/vast-connection-cycle/">Michael Sahota</a>.</p><h2>VAST Cycle</h2><div id="attachment_2692" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/trustartist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/VAST-Cycle.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2692" src="http://i2.wp.com/trustartist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/VAST-Cycle.jpg?resize=580%2C435" alt="VAST Cycle" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">VAST Cycle</p></div><blockquote><p><b>VAST</b> =<br /><b>V</b>ulnerability<br /><b>A</b>uthentic Connection<br /><b>S</b>afety<br /><b>T</b>rust</p></blockquote><p><b>How to use VAST for Yourself</b></p><p>We use VAST as a way to navigate relationships. It works in personal and professional contexts.</p><p>Use VAST for introspection: In relation to another, we may ask ourselves:</p><ul><li>How trusting am I?</li><li>How safe do I feel?</li><li>How connected do I feel?</li><li>How vulnerable am I choosing to be?</li><li>Am I acting authentically?</li></ul><p>With this new awareness, the model suggests a variety of moves:</p><ul><li>I can choose to be vulnerable and share how I feel. How I am feeling unsafe. How I am not trusting.</li><li>I can choose to trust the other person and see how my behaviour shifts.</li><li>I can state what I want. “I want to restart this conversation. I want to focus on how we can support each other. I want to focus on the goal.”</li><li>I can ask for help.</li></ul><p>In our experience, the most powerful move is vulnerability. Owning our experience and how we feel and then sharing it really kicks off the cycle. That’s what we mean by showing up.</p><p><b>VAST for Organizations</b></p><p>We use VAST to build awareness and choice for organizations. It is especially useful when contrasting with <a href="/2015/01/15/organisational-debt-cycle/" target="_blank">organisational debt (fear, mistrust)</a> as a way of being.</p><p>A team, group, or organization may choose it as a future way of being. The cycle helps guide behaviour and create ideas for experiments.</p><p>We can use it in retrospectives, to collect narratives that demonstrate the behaviour we want. Acknowledge when someone was daring, inspiring us to move forward.</p><p>Run a <a title="Temenos" href="http://trustartist.com/project/temenos/">Temenos lab</a> to experience the cycle for yourself or with your team.</p><h2>Origins of VAST</h2><p>The VAST cycle is the result of a sense-making journey between Michael and I over the past years. We have been learning and studying its elements to help ourselves and our clients grow.</p><p>If you’ve <a title="Magnificence Mantra" href="http://trustartist.com/2012/06/12/magnificence-mantra/">followed my blog</a> over the years, you’ll know that one of my first and major influences over the years have been <a href="http://www.mccarthyshow.com/">Jim and Michele McCarthy</a>, creator of the <a href="http://liveingreatness.com/core-protocols/">Core Protocols</a> (part of my <a title="Culture Fitness Training" href="http://trustartist.com/service-portfolio/culture-fitness-training/">Culture Fitness Training</a>) and Bootcamp. They’ve inspired and encouraged me to talk about and work with vulnerability, and even love, in a work context. They even wrote about the <a href="http://www.mccarthyshow.com/2014/the-virtous-cycle-of-software/">virtuous cycle of software</a> recently, which I had not been aware of when Michael and I worked on this post. Thank you!</p><p>Pascal Pinck and Siraj Sirajuddin have introduced us to Temenos, which has been another core part of our learning journey where we discovered these insights.</p><p>The term &#8220;VAST&#8221; was created by Anton Gillis-Adelman &#8211; who is an expert in turning a jumble of letters into words.</p><h2>Related Work</h2><ul><li>Brene Brown has taught us greatly on “The Power of Vulnerability” and the need for Authentic Connection.</li><li>Our earlier work includes <a href="http://agilitrix.com/2012/05/deep-insights-around-fear-risk-safety-and-vulnerability/">Deep Insights around Fear, Risk, Safety and Vulnerability</a> and <a href="http://trustartist.com/2014/10/07/vulnerability-courage-meets-fear/">Vulnerability: Where Courage Meets Fear</a></li><li><a title="Temenos" href="http://trustartist.com/project/temenos/">Temenos</a> is an experiential workshop where we’ve learned how this works</li></ul><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://trustartist.com/2015/01/19/vast-cycle-for-connection/">VAST &#8211; Virtuous Cycle for Connection</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://trustartist.com">Trust Artist</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

I like to experiment with new recipes, ingredients, and ways to cook. That&#8217;s leading—exploring the boundaries of my comfort zone. I will only do that when I know the people who come for dinner—managing the risk. Limiting the options of upsetting somebody! If I happen to cook for people I don&#8217;t know well, I&#8217;ll choose a dish I&#8217;ve done before and feel safe to do well.</p><h2>How This Came About</h2><p>After the above tweet after a meeting in London in September I started thinking about <a title="Inspiring Blog: Chris Matts — ITRiskManager" href="http://trustartist.com/2014/03/26/inspiring-chris-matts/">Chris&#8217; words</a>. In a bookstore in Copenhagen in November, I found a book by Jessica Hagy of <a href="http://thisisindexed.com/2015/01/%C2%AF_%E3%83%84_%C2%AF-frictionless-changes/">ThisIsIndexed</a> fame: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0761174702">How to be Interesting</a>. It contains a great drawing about the distance between our comfort zone and &#8220;Where the Magic Happens&#8221;, and inspired me to tweak it like this:</p><div id="attachment_2590" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/trustartist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/comfort-trust-magic.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2590" src="http://i2.wp.com/trustartist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/comfort-trust-magic.png?resize=580%2C435" alt="Leave Our Comfort Zone" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Leave Our Comfort Zone</p></div><p>Preparing my keynote for the Toronto Agile Conference with Michael Sahota, the combination of <a title="Real Options—A Mindset" href="http://trustartist.com/2012/08/15/real-options-a-mindset/">Real Options</a>, the comfort zone metaphor and Chris&#8217; definition converged into this new idea.</p><p>How do you like it?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://trustartist.com/2015/01/17/management-and-leadership/">Management AND Leadership</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://trustartist.com">Trust Artist</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Why?" href="http://trustartist.com/2015/01/14/mentoring/">mentoring offer</a> I&#8217;m working on. I mentioned the pattern of serendipitous conversations where change actually happens. His summary blew me away: &#8220;Oh, you mean, change happens when pain, desire and safety meet?&#8221;</p><p>Yes. That is true.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Change may happen when Pain and Desire meet Safety.</strong></p></blockquote><div id="attachment_2676" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/trustartist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_20150115_151853.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2676" src="http://i0.wp.com/trustartist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_20150115_151853.jpg?resize=580%2C435" alt="1-800-GET-SAFETY" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">1-800-GET-SAFETY (by Pascal Pinck)</p></div><h2>Safety on Demand</h2><p>Nice concept: <strong>Remote mentoring is safety on demand</strong>. I talked to a potential client yesterday and he loved the on-demand help I was offering. For big changes, the setup and budgeting and planning and waiting is ok. For small to medium and urgent changes, the waiting is not ok. Having a number to call to get external help, an external perspective, guidance, or advice, could be very helpful and minimise risk.</p><p>The different kinds of help we discussed made me think about what&#8217;s really essential. Essential for this remote support to be valuable and essential for this service to be unique, to become my own. I noticed <strong>there&#8217;s more to it than just safety</strong>, and expertise.</p><p>I pay exquisite attention.</p><h2>Attention on Demand</h2><p>I will relabel my mentoring offer. From now on it&#8217;s called <strong>Exquisite Attention</strong>.</p><p>The reasoning is two-fold:</p><ul><li>It just states exactly what I offer, no more or less. It gives you the choice how you want to use my attention. Attention has no presupposition that I know something you don&#8217;t, that I&#8217;m advanced in any way. It doesn&#8217;t presuppose that you need help. And it does give you the best possible context to ask for it. Attention is a <strong>non-dual</strong> concept.</li><li>Exquisite Attention is valuable, and potentially worth paying for. I can pay <strong>exquisite attention</strong> to a friend, and we can <strong>pay</strong> exquisite attention to one another. Attention is a gift economy concept.</li></ul><h2>Customer Development</h2><p>Please help me developing this further by answering this question in a comment:</p><blockquote><p>If I offered you Exquisite Attention, what would you use it for?</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://trustartist.com/2015/01/17/pain-desire-safety/">Pain, Desire and Safety</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://trustartist.com">Trust Artist</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                <![CDATA[<p>Many consider the modern workplace inhumane and uninhabitable. People are not fully engaged. It is killing our bottom lines. It is putting our organisations at risk. With our prevailing management system we have created a vast organisational debt that inhibits growth and performance.</p><p>We define <em>organisational debt</em> as the baggage that prevents people from delivering astonishing results. The diagram below shows the key problems that impact each human being and ultimately the effectiveness of our whole organisation.</p><p>Joint post with <a href="http://agilitrix.com/2015/01/organizational-debt-cycle/">Michael Sahota</a>.</p><h2>Organisational Debt Cycle</h2><p>This is how the organizational debt cycle works:</p><p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/agilitrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Organizational-Debt-Cyle.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-4034" src="http://i2.wp.com/agilitrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Organizational-Debt-Cyle-630x454.jpg?resize=630%2C454" alt="Organizational Debt Cyle" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p><p>We learn not to trust people we don’t know well, so our first principle is not to trust anyone. We act as if we’re afraid and sometimes we are. We want to be safe, avoid to be noticed, avoid to stand out. The more we cover our *ss, the less we connect. The less we connect, the more we feel alone… and can’t build any trust. The cycle continues.</p><p>The cycle works the other way, too: We start being afraid, not trusting people, feeling alone, so we make sure we don’t get hurt…</p><h2>Impact</h2><p>There is a direct connection between each of these problems and our organisation’s effectiveness. For example:</p><ul><li>No trust → I will try to do this myself rather than cooperate with you. I don’t believe in my leaders.</li><li>Fear → I will not ask for help when I need it. I will not take any risks that might improve things.</li><li>Cover your *ss → I will not report important information. I will not speak up to avoid disaster.</li><li>Alone → I will disengage. I will be powerless and not valued.</li></ul><p>Henry Ford reportedly said that “every pair of hands comes with its own brain”. Many people got used to leave their brain at the door when they came to work. In many organisations people additionally leave their hearts outside. We don’t fully show up at work.<br />Prominent words like “work-life-balance” only make sense if we leave our life outside when we go to work. This cycle describes how we do that and why we keep doing it. We don’t feel we have a choice.</p><h2>How We Create Organisational Debt</h2><p>In organisations we create structures to support it:</p><ul><li>RACI matrices have single responsibilities → alone</li><li>Performance reviews → fear</li><li>Reports are expected to match plans → cover your *ss</li><li>Don’t rock the boat → cover your ass</li><li>Gap between what we say and do → Trust no one</li></ul><p>As leaders, we may unwittingly create or support an organisational culture where mistrust and fear impair performance.</p><h2>How to Use this Model</h2><p>The purpose of this model is to create <em>awareness</em>. When we choose to acknowledge and accept what is actually going on, then new behaviours and choices automatically emerge. Once we decide that we no longer wish to operate in this cycle, we may then ask, “What do we wish for ourselves?”</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://trustartist.com/2015/01/15/organisational-debt-cycle/">Organisational Debt Cycle</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://trustartist.com">Trust Artist</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                <![CDATA[<p>Over the last months a new kind of service has been evolving in my business: <a title="Confidence Mentoring" href="http://trustartist.com/project/mentoring/">Mentoring</a>. Shortly before Christmas I started to deliberately grow it. I&#8217;ve got great feedback from early clients. I&#8217;ve <a title="Mentoring Ideas" href="http://trustartist.com/2015/01/04/mentoring-ideas/">shared ideas earlier</a> and <a title="AgileCoachCamp Norway 2015" href="http://trustartist.com/2015/01/11/agilecoachcamp-norway-2015/">talked to colleagues at ACCN</a>. In this post I want to explain why I like it and want to grow it further. I&#8217;m <strong>interested in your feedback</strong>!</p><h2>Influencing At My Best</h2><p>My <strong>most effective moments</strong> have been conversations where I could provide opportunity for</p><ul><li>a major insight,</li><li>a break-through learning,</li><li>a shift in behaviour or consciousness</li></ul><p>to happen. Most of these conversations happened to be <strong>one-on-one</strong>. The pattern they all had in common has been that</p><ul><li>the person I talked to was <strong>aware of an issue</strong> or challenge, AND</li><li>they <strong>wanted</strong> something <strong>to change</strong>.</li></ul><p>Within the context of me working for an organisation, paying a visit for a length of some days, <strong>these conversations have been mostly serendipitous</strong>.</p><p>I want to make them happen <strong>more frequently, and deliberately</strong>.</p><h2>(Remote) Mentoring</h2><p>I want my clients to be able to book these conversations deliberately, on demand. Whenever you have an issue and want change, call me.</p><div id="attachment_2446" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/trustartist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/AwarenessOptionsChoice.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2446" src="http://i0.wp.com/trustartist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/AwarenessOptionsChoice.png?resize=580%2C435" alt="Three Elements of Change" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Three Elements of Change</p></div><p>I will help <strong>raise your awareness</strong>, and <strong>identify options</strong>, so that you can <strong>make good choices</strong>. I call this <a title="Confidence Mentoring" href="http://trustartist.com/project/mentoring/">Mentoring</a>.</p><h2>Mentoring: What&#8217;s In It For Me?</h2><p>Remote Mentoring is convenient and beneficial for me:</p><ul><li>It&#8217;s easy to set up, there is little overhead.</li><li>I don&#8217;t need to look for problems, I can focus on solutions.</li><li>It&#8217;s rewarding, as I can affect more change.</li><li>I don&#8217;t need to travel and can spend more time at home.</li><li>My schedule is far more flexible.</li></ul><h2>Mentoring: What&#8217;s In It For You, the Mentee?</h2><p>Remote Mentoring is convenient and beneficial for you:</p><ul><li>I&#8217;ll be where ever you are (as long as you have decent internet).</li><li>You schedule sessions as you need them.</li><li>You pick what you need: advice, coaching, teaching, feedback, a compassionate and critical mirror&#8230;</li><li>Clear commitment for a number of sessions that you choose.</li></ul><h2>Mentoring: What&#8217;s In It For Your Organisation?</h2><p>Remote Mentoring is a convenient and beneficial alternative to a coach/consultant like me coming on site, to your office:</p><ul><li>No travel costs.</li><li>Invitation for your staff. No one is forced to change, so there&#8217;s little resistance.</li><li>You only pay those hours where people wanting to change want to have a conversation to achieve the change.</li><li>You get an external perspective on your organisation at a very low price.</li><li>You can test if you and your people want to work with me with a very low initial investment.</li><li>You can check if your staff wants a change you want before investing much money. If no one wants to talk to the Agile Coach…</li></ul><h2>How is Mentoring Different From Coaching?</h2><p>Coaching is an integral part of mentoring. In addition, you&#8217;re invited to ask for advice, my opinion, my experience…</p><p>In other words: I will help you grow your potential, and use mine as well if you want me to.</p><h2>Feedback, Ideas</h2><p>What are your experiences with mentoring? Which chances and risks do you see? Do you want to give it a try?</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://trustartist.com/2015/01/14/mentoring/">Mentoring.

Inviting people to change has a much higher probability to work.</li><li>This law nicely fits into my recent definition of management and leadership:</li></ol><blockquote><p>Management is keeping our comfort zone comfortable, management is limiting our options to increase focus and safety.<br />Leadership is moving or expanding our comfort zone, exploring new options together.<br />Both are activities, not positions, and they always go together.</p></blockquote><p>We did agree that in many current organisations we have too much management and not enough leadership.</p><p>Thank you Olve Maudal for the inspirational idea to apply Newton&#8217;s mechanics to organisational dynamics!</p><h2>Mentoring</h2><p>I proposed a conversation around mentoring, exploring two questions:</p><ol><li>How is mentoring different from coaching?</li><li>How can we integrate remote mentoring into the way we currently work with organisations, to deliver our help in ways that limit risk, provide safety, and increase (cost) effectiveness?</li></ol><p>I&#8217;ll write more about that tomorrow <img src="http://i1.wp.com/trustartist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" data-recalc-dims="1" /> </p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://trustartist.com/2015/01/11/agilecoachcamp-norway-2015/">AgileCoachCamp Norway 2015</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://trustartist.com">Trust Artist</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

                <![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about value creation in human systems, as the world is becoming more and more complex. I believe that in today&#8217;s economy, it&#8217;s increasingly rare and unlikely that value is created in a single mind.</p><p><strong>The value is created in the connections.</strong></p><p>So, how do we connect? How can we become more intentional about value in our connections? I came up with this simple model:</p><div id="attachment_2651" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/trustartist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ValueOfConnection.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2651" src="http://i0.wp.com/trustartist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ValueOfConnection.png?resize=580%2C435" alt="Value of Connection" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Value of Connection</p></div><p>This is a very first draft of this model. It helps me make sense of connections, and become more intentional and aware of our level of consciousness in the connection. I assume that <strong>conversations and collaboration become more valuable when we connect with a higher level of consciousness</strong>.</p><p>I&#8217;ll give a brief explanation of the layers and a simple example, inviting you into the conversation:</p><h2>Trust</h2><p>Trust is the wire. Without trust, there can&#8217;t be connection. The level and kind of trust determines the potential value of the connection.</p><h2>Shared Context</h2><p>Humans act within contexts. We sense our context and respond to it. How we act and how we connect depends on our perceived level of influence on the context. To connect with another human being, we need some shared context. We need to meet somewhere.</p><h2>Shared Protocol</h2><p>To connect we need to communicate. We need to understand. A shared protocol — a common language, for instance — is needed to understand each other. Highly valuable connections have highly optimised protocols. The level of consciousness of our protocols will determine the effectiveness of value creation.</p><h2>Shared Purpose</h2><p>Why do we connect? What&#8217;s our purpose to grow and nurture the connection? The more clarity we have on our shared purpose, the easier it will be to create value, the more valuable options we are going to see emerging.</p><h2>Example</h2><p>Let&#8217;s take meeting a stranger on an internet forum as an example. I&#8217;ve found that interest groups on the internet tend to yield valuable conversations quicker and more frequently than many other environments.</p><p>The level of <strong>trust</strong> is quite high to begin with, as we&#8217;re sharing a common interest in a topic. The web gives us the infrastructure to meet and maybe a thread of conversation—that&#8217;s our <strong>context</strong>. The netiquette is a good example of a shared <strong>protocol</strong>. The <strong>purpose</strong> of the group is preset, the purpose of our conversation is emergent—it probably starts with getting to know each other.</p><h2>Feedback</h2><p>This idea is fresh from my mind, I&#8217;m asking for your feedback.</p><p>Is it helpful? Valuable? Does my explanation make sense? What am I missing?</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://trustartist.com/2015/01/04/value-connections/">Value is in the Connections</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://trustartist.com">Trust Artist</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>
